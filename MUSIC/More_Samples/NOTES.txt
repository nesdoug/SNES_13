I (Doug Fraker) made all these samples
Consider them public domain
(free to use)

for SNESGSS
.gsi is the instrument file 
(instruments tab/load)
SNESGSS can export the original WAV from it.
(intruments menu/extract source wav)

All samples are tuned to B +21 cents, usually
having a loop of 32,64,128,or 256 samples per loop

except the drums have not been retuned
nor has the "WhistleG" sample

.brr
brr versions have been included, which can be
used for SMW, AddmusicK.
These brr files have a 2 byte loop point at
the beginning of the file. You may need to
remove those 2 bytes for purposes other than SMW.
