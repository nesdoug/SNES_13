There was a bug, which doesn't show up in emulators, but
will sometimes cause a real SNES to hang / crash 
waiting for a value to change, but it never does.

I didn't try to re-assemble the spc code, but rather
hand assembled a patch, and typed them in a hex editor.


;patch [offset in the spc700.bin] {offset in the snesgss.exe}
{the spc code starts at d19d0}

mainloop
224 (26) {d19f6}
E4 F4 F0 0F C4 F4 FD 28 0F 1C 5D DD 9F 28 0F FD 1F E9 08
to...cmdStreamStart+3
e4 f4 64 f4 d0 fa fd f0 0a c4 f4 3f 23 03 00 ""

we put in calima's code
and jsr call here from main loop

jsr $323   3f 23 03

rts 6f
jmp 5f ????
any jmp command done = 
5f 37 02

mainloop: calima's code from nesdev forum to fix bug
lda cpu0	e4 f4
cmp cpu0	64 f4
bne mainloop d0 fa	we added 4 bytes + 3 for jsr = 7
tay			 fd
beq commanddone f0 0a
sta cpu0   c4 f4

jsr $323   3f 23 03
nop   00



tay    fd

cmdStreamStart

323 (125) {d1af5}
3F 19 07 E8 00 C4 25 C4 24 3F 3C 04 3F E8 03 E8 FF 
change to...
5f 37 02/fd 28 0f 1c 5d dd 9f 28 0f 6f


320
change to jmp commandDone

then the patch 323
(323 is jsr point)

cmdStreamSend

change to jmp commandDone

This was modified in the snesgss exe file so this
process won't have to be done again.
File now called snesgssP.exe P for patch.

This guts streaming audio, which will now not function.
(in order to fit the patch)
