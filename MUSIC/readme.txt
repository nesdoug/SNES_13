The sole purpose of this software is to make music and sound effects for
SNES homebrew games. It is not meant to be a stand-alone music authoring
software in any way.



The editor works in semi-interactive mode. This means that the result of
any changes (even mute controls) will only be heard after restarting the
song, you can't hear the changes immediately. It is supposed that during
editing the song is mostly played using the Enter key (play from current
position).

The system architecture uses a single sample bank for every song and
sound effect in a game. The sound driver along with sample bank is fully
loaded at start up. Sound effects created as shorter songs (marked as
sound effect), they also loaded along with the driver. Larger songs are
loaded on a one-by-one basis. It is kind of MIDI concept, music files
only contain notes and commands, while sound bank contains the actual
sounds used by the music files.

It is supposed that WAV samples are resampled and looped in an external
audio editor, Wavosaur or similar. The samples should be 16 bit mono,
sampled at 8000, 16000, or 32000 Hz (the latter is preferable), with
melodic content preferably tuned to B (of any octave) +21 cent. In other
words, change pitch of a C-tuned sample 79 cents down. The reason behind
this is the BRR encoding that works with 16 sample blocks, with this
tuning a simple waveform will be a multiple of 16, improving looping
quality. Pitch table is calculated to map the B +21 sampled instrument
to actual C note on the C key, producing the standard tuning. To play
a sample close to its original sample rate, use B key.

The editor could be invoked as a command line application to perform
project file to set of resulting files conversion. Use snesgss.exe
filename.gsm -e [optional export path]

The MIDI import supports both format 0 and 1. It expects that notes are
placed in channels 1-8 (or 1-6 plus drum channel), and there is no more
than 1 note in a channel at a time. It imports notes only, with
instrument assigned by the channel number. If the drum channel is
present, it gets imported into SNES channels 7-8, channel 7 is used for
hats, and channel 8 for kick, snare, and toms. Instrument numbers
assigned to different drums are 10 for kick, 11 for snare, 12 for toms,
13 for hats.

Row fields

RRRR SS [CH1..CH8]

RRRR is the row number
SS   is speed, could be set per row, 1 to 99 (fastest to slowest, default is 20).
CH1..CH8 are note fields, see below



Note fields

C#3iiVVEvv

C  is note (# sharp)
ii is the instrument number, 1..99
VV is the volume, 0..99 (lowest to highest)
E  is the effect name
vv is the effect value, only editable if the effect is specified



Effects

All effect values are decimal, in 0..99 range.

All effects applied to the channel continuously. To turn off an effect other than the pan,
use it with 00 as value

Txx is (de)Tune, sets constant pitch offset that is applied to all following notes
Uxx is Slide Up, 0 is none, 1 is slowest, 99 is fastest
Dxx is Slide Down
Pxx is Portamento, 0 is note, 1 is slowest, 99 is fastest; has priority over the Slide
       P99 is legato mode, pitch changes instantly, like on a new note, but without key on
Sxx is Pan, 0 is the leftmost, 50 is the center, 99 is the rightmost positions
Vxy is Vibrato, x is speed (1 slowest, 9 fastest), y is depth (1 min, 9 max)
R.. is Repeat, it repeats previous section in current channel, from beginning of the section

Export and use

When all music and sound effects created, the project can be exported
(File>Export) for further use in a SNES program. The editor exports
a number of files:

spc700.bin -  contains compiled SPC700 driver code, samples, sound effects
              data. This means you don't need to use a SPC700 assembler.

music_N.bin - contains music data. Each sub song that is not marked as a
              sound effect will be exported into separate file. This allows
			  to save room for more sample data, while music data is only
			  loaded when needed.

sounds.asm  - contains incbin's in the WLA DX format, considering LoROM
              configuration.

sounds.h    - contains automatically generated aliases for every sub song
              and sound effect, as well as sub song names.

The latter two files aren't necessary, they meant to be used in a specific
SNES dev environment. The interfacing part of the environment is provided
along with the editor in the /snes/ directory, it consist of two files,
sneslib.asm and sneslib.h. There are 65816 assembly functions to load the
SPC700 driver and communicate with it, as well as C interface to these
functions.

You can either adapt provided code for your purposes, or create a new one,
using the code as a guide. spc700.bin loading and starting address is
$0200. When the driver is loaded, communication is done through APU ports
using the communication routines (see snes/sneslib.asm:542 and beyond).
Driver loading code is in snes/sneslib.h:774. 'Play a sound effect'
function is in sneslib.asm:842, it also uses spc_command_asm routine
(uniform for most commands), which is in sneslib.asm:658.

The spc700.asm file in the /snes/ directory is only provided for reference,
in case you're interested in internals of the driver. It does not need to
be compiled or otherwise used in a SNES program.

Take a note that, unlike the editor or exported SPC file, driver starts in
mono mode, for compatibility reasons, as many old TV sets does not have
stereo, and some part of the sound would be missing. To get stereo output,
the stereo enable command must be sent first.
